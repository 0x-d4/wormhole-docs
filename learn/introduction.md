# Introduction to Wormhole

Wormhole is a generic **message-passing protocol** that enables communication between blockchains.

![Overview](/wormhole-mkdocs/images/learn/introduction/overview.webp)

!!! note
    The above is an oversimplified illustration of the protocol; details about the architecture and components are available in the **[architecture page](#){target=\_blank}**.


This simple message-passing protocol allows developers and users of cross-chain applications to leverage the advantages of multiple ecosystems.

## What Isn't Wormhole?

- **Wormhole is _not_ a blockchain** - it provides a means of communication between blockchains or rollups

- **Wormhole is _not_ a token bridge** - however, there are **[protocols built on Wormhole](https://portalbridge.com/#/transfer){target=\_blank}** that serve this purpose

## What Can Wormhole Be Used For?

Consider the following examples of potential applications enabled by Wormhole:

- **Cross-Chain Exchange** - using **[Wormhole Connect](#){target=\_blank}**, developers can build exchanges that allow deposits from any Wormhole-connected chain, significantly increasing liquidity access
- **Cross-Chain Governance** - NFT collections on different networks can use Wormhole to communicate votes cast on their respective chains to a designated "voting" chain for combined proposals
- **Cross-Chain Game** - games can be developed on a performant network like Solana, with rewards issued as NFTs on another network, such as Ethereum

## Get Started

### Quick Start Tutorials

Tutorials are available to get started quickly and explain the concepts involved.

- **[Quick Start - Off Chain](#){target=\_blank}** - integrate Wormhole Connect into a new or existing web UI
- **[Quick Start - On Chain](#){target=\_blank}** - send your first cross-chain message

More tutorials are available **[on github](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/docs.wormhole.com/blob/main/docs/tutorials/quick-start/README.md){target=\_blank}**.
