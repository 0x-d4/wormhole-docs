!!! note
    The above is an oversimplified illustration of the protocol, details about the architecture and components are available [here](#).


This simple message-passing protocol allows developers and users of cross-chain applications to leverage the advantages of multiple ecosystems.

### What Isn't Wormhole?

- **Wormhole is not a blockchain**: It provides a means of communication between blockchains or rollups.
- **Wormhole is not a token bridge**: However, there are [protocols built on Wormhole](https://portalbridge.com/#/transfer) that serve this purpose.

### What Can Wormhole Be Used For?

Consider the following examples of potential applications enabled by Wormhole:

- **Cross-Chain Exchange**: Using [Wormhole Connect](#), developers can build exchanges that allow deposits from any Wormhole-connected chain, significantly increasing liquidity access.
- **Cross-Chain Governance**: NFT collections on different networks can use Wormhole to communicate votes cast on their respective chains to a designated "voting" chain for combined proposals.
- **Cross-Chain Game**: Games can be developed on a performant network like Solana, with rewards issued as NFTs on another network, such as Ethereum.

### Get Started

#### Quick Start Tutorials

Tutorials are available to get started quickly and explain the concepts involved.

- **Quick Start - Off Chain**: Integrate Wormhole Connect into a new or existing web UI.
- **Quick Start - On Chain**: Send your first cross-chain message.
