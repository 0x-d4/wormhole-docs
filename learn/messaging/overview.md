# Messaging Overview

The Messaging section covers various aspects and services related to communication protocols and systems within our platform. Each subsection provides detailed information on specific components, contracts, and bridges used for messaging and data transfer. Below is a brief overview of each subsection:

## Core Contracts

The Core Contracts form the backbone of Wormhole's cross-chain communication system, allowing for the emission and receipt of messages across different blockchains. Each blockchain in the ecosystem has its own Core Contract, which Guardians observe to ensure the integrity and synchronization of data. These contracts handle message sending, receiving, and multicast, providing a seamless mechanism for inter-chain communication without additional costs.

## NTT (Native Token Transfers)

Native Token Transfers (NTT) provide a flexible and composable framework for transferring tokens across blockchains. NTT supports two modes: locking mode, which preserves the original token supply on a single chain, and burning mode, which enables the distribution of the token supply across multiple chains. Key features include unified user experience, no need for liquidity pools, integrator flexibility, advanced rate limiting, and custom attestations. The system components consist of Managers and Transceivers, facilitating secure and customizable cross-chain token transfers.

## Token and NFT Bridge

The Token and NFT Bridges facilitate cross-chain transfers of both fungible tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Utilizing a lock and mint mechanism, the bridge ensures secure and efficient asset movement between blockchains. The Token Bridge allows for token transfers with specific receiver details, while the NFT Bridge handles the transfer of unique digital assets with specialized rules for creating wrapped versions on the destination chain.
