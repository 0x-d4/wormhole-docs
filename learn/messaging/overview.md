# Messaging Overview

The Messaging section covers various aspects and services related to communication protocols and systems within our platform. Each subsection provides detailed information on specific components, contracts, and bridges used for messaging and data transfer. Below is a brief overview of each subsection:

## Core Contracts

The Core Contracts form the backbone of Wormhole's cross-chain communication system, allowing for the emission and receipt of messages across different blockchains. Each blockchain in the ecosystem has its own Core Contract, which Guardians observe to ensure the integrity and synchronization of data. These contracts handle message sending, receiving, and multicast, providing a seamless mechanism for inter-chain communication without additional costs.

## NTT (Native Token Transfers)

## Token and NFT Bridge

The Token and NFT Bridges facilitate cross-chain transfers of both fungible tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Utilizing a lock and mint mechanism, the bridge ensures secure and efficient asset movement between blockchains. The Token Bridge allows for token transfers with specific receiver details, while the NFT Bridge handles the transfer of unique digital assets with specialized rules for creating wrapped versions on the destination chain.

## CCTP and Circle Bridge

The CCTP and Circle Bridge support fast and cost-effective native USDC transfers across blockchains using Circle's Cross Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP). While distinct from Wormhole, this protocol is enhanced by Wormhole's features such as automated relaying, gas payment on the destination chain, and native gas dropoff, making it more user-friendly. The integration can be achieved through the Wormhole Connect Widget or the Connect SDK, providing a seamless experience for developers and users.
